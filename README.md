# English to Katakana using reinforcement learning

Translation from english to katakana using reinforcement learning

Why?
There are lots of python packages which gives romaji to katakana (ex. romkan), but sometimes they dont work that well(ex. adobe translation).
Sometimes english syllables translation into different katakana syllables, there is not one single rule. I believe these set of rules can be learnt using reinforcement learning.
Also I have taken courses on reinforcement learning, but never tried using it for my personal project. This will be my first attempt.
